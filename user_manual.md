# Introduction:
Fitness in Training is a web application designed to meet the needs of users who are seeking to find personalized nutrition and workout plans to help make attaining their goals easier. This app is designed for anyone who has the desire to start eating and working out towards a goal, but have no idea where to start.
This application is as simple to use as possible. There is no login necessary. It is completely free and can be accessed as many times as needed by a user. It will generate meal and workout plans based on the userâ€™s desired needs and will be ready and sent to the user immediately. The user can choose either to generate just a fitness plan, a meal plan, or both.
